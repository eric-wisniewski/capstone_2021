This repository will contain all of the necessary files which the project requires.

## Data ##

To see all the dat which was operated upon is within the source located [here.](https://github.com/eric-wisniewski/capstone_2021/tree/main/Files) The folder contains both .xlsx and .csv files, this was done in order to operate on them within R for statistical analysis and forecasting methods. 

### Data Manipulation ###

In order to get a more precise collection of data to answer I only used partial amounts of data from some of the sources. I also had to manipulate the columns and rows of sources as well. The sources for which I include in this description are Agriculture, US Production & Sales, US & China Import Export Difference, US Imports by Code, and US/China GDP.

* Agriculture
	> For this data set I needed to dowload multiple years in different CSV files, and then convert the top exports, which include soybeans, wheat, and cotton, from each year into a single file.

* US Production & Sales
	> All of the data was operated upon in this case, but when looking at the dataset in it's original form, it was set up that the rows horiztonally contained most of the data. So I had to rearrange the data so the labels were vertically over the values within the data.

* US Imports by Code
	> In the comparison I was looking at with this dataset was Technology & Business imports from China, so I had only gathered the necessary data from the overall dataset. (Both are Included in /Files)

* US/China GDP
	> Seeing how the comparison between the two nations is dealing with a more recent trade escalation, I only used values from 2010 -2021.

* US & China Import Export Difference
	> In this dataset are monthly figures of the imports and exports to and from China. I contained values from January 2016 to January 2021.

## Injuiry Question ##
Using data on GDP and public availablity on Imports/Exports on which tariffs were put on, measure effectiveness for both nations and conclude on overall trends which the data implies. Predict short-term and long-term affects if tariffs are still in place as they were when they began.
